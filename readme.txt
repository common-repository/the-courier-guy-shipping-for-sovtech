== Description ==
  
Shesha by The Courier Guy plugin for WooCommerce allows the seller to give live courier quotes and ship your parcels with a click of a button.

***DISCLAIMER***

Parcel sizes are based on your packaging structure. The plugin will compare the cart’s total dimensions against “Flyer”, “Medium”, “Large” and “Custom” parcel sizes to determine the best fit. The resulting calculation will be submitted to The Courier Guy as using the parcel’s dimensions. By downloading and using this plugin, you accept that incorrect Product and Parcel Size and Weight settings may cause quotes to be inaccurate, and The Courier Guy will not be responsible for these inaccurate quotes.
